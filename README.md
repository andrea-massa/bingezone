A small client side application which allows users to search for TV shows. (In progress).

Although I could have developed this application way more efficientely using JQuery, I decided to not use any libraries or framework in order to practice 'vanilla' JavaScript.

I plan to add more functionality to this application, such as a way to click on the show in order to view more details (num episodes...)
