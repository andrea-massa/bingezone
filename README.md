A small client side application which allows users to search for TV shows. 

Although I could have developed this application way more efficientely using JQuery, I decided to not use any libraries or framework in order to practice 'vanilla' JavaScript.

Data for shows was provided by the TV Maze API, for specific endpoints please look at source code.

I plan to add more functionality to this application, such as a way to click on the show in order to view more details (num episodes...)
